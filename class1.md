# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of machines and computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.

**TYPES OF AI Based on Capabilities**

1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Designed to perform specific tasks, such as voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, facial recognition software, and recommendation engines. These systems operate within a limited context and do not possess general intelligence.

2. General AI (AGI or Strong AI)
A theoretical concept where machines possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. AGI remains a subject of ongoing research and development.

3. Super AI (Artificial Superintelligence)
A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity, problem-solving, and emotional understanding. Super AI could revolutionize industries but also raises significant ethical and safety concerns.

### MACHINE LEARNING 

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) or a way to achieve AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models enabling computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. 

**TYPES OF ML ---**

1. Supervised Learning
Definition: Models are trained on labeled datasets, learning to predict outcomes based on input-output pairs.

Use Cases: Spam detection, disease diagnosis, credit scoring.

Algorithms: Linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines.

2. Unsupervised Learning
Definition: Models analyze unlabeled data to identify hidden patterns or groupings.

Use Cases: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, market basket analysis.

Algorithms: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA).

3. Reinforcement Learning
Definition: An agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

Use Cases: Robotics, game AI (e.g., AlphaGo), autonomous vehicles.

Key Concepts: Exploration vs. exploitation, reward maximization. 

4. Semi-Supervised Learning
Definition: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

Use Cases: Web content classification, speech recognition.

Benefit: Reduces the cost and effort of labeling large datasets.
